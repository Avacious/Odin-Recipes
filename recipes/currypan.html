    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the curry, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the onion and fry for 5 minutes or until golden brown</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, curry powder, and garam masala, then cook the roux for a few minutes, stirring constantly</li>
        <li>Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the carrot, cauliflower, and peas and cook until tender, stirring frequently to ensure the sauce doesn't catch</li>
        <li>Stir in the soy sauce, ketchup, and chili sauce (if using) then remove from heat and chill thoroughly</li>
        <li>To make the dough, stir together the yeast and milk until the yeast dissolves, then stir the mixture into the eggs</li>
        <li>Place the flours, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl and mix lightly, then add the liquid ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix by hand or on low speed for 2 minutes, then turn the speed up to medium and mix for another 7 minutes or knead on a floured surface for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the butter and knead or mix for a further 5 minutes until no chunks of butter remain and the dough is very smooth and soft</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in a plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll them into balls</li>
    </ol>
