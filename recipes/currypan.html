        <li>60ml (1/4cup) lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>

        <li>15g (1 tablespoon) caster sugar</li>
        <li>80g (3oz) butter, softened and cut into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To assemble and serve</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, beaten with a splash of water or milk</li>
        <li>40g (1-1/2oz) panko</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying (about 1.5 litres or 6 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the curry, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the onion and fry for 5 minutes or until golden brown</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, curry powder, and garam masala, then cook the roux for a few minutes, stirring constantly</li>
        <li>Add the stock and bring to a boil. Add the carrot, cauliflower, and peas and cook until tender, stirring frequently to ensure the sauce doesn't catch</li>
        <li>Stir in the soy sauce, ketchup, and chili sauce (if using) then remove from heat and chill thoroughly</li>
        <li>To make the dough, stir together the yeast and milk until the yeast dissolves, then stir the mixture into the eggs</li>
        <li>Place the flours, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl and mix lightly, then add the liquid ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix by hand or on low speed for 2 minutes, then turn the speed up to medium and mix for another 7 minutes or knead on a floured surface for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the butter and knead or mix for a further 5 minutes until no chunks of butter remain and the dough is very smooth and soft</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in a plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and roll them into balls</li>
        <li>Roll the balls out into rounds about 10cm across, then flatten out the edges a little</li>
        <li>Place a big spoonful of curry in the center of each round, then fold over and press the edges together firmly to tightly seal in the curry</li>
        <li>Crimp the sealed edges of each doughnut using a fold and roll motion like making a pastry, then turn the doughnuts onto a lightly oiled tray, sealed upside down</li>
        <li>Transfer to the fridge and chill for at least 1 hour</li>
        <li>Place the panko on a tray or plate. Brush each doughnut with the egg wash, then roll through the panko</li>
        <li>Cover the doughnuts loosely in plastic wrap and leave to prove in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until they have nearly doubled in size</li>
        <li>Heat the oil to 320F and carefully lower thedoughnuts into the oil, 2 or 3 at a time, sealed side down</li>
        <li>After a few seconds, flip the doughnuts over so the seam is now at the top</li>
        <li>fry for 8 minutes, turning frequently, until they are golden brown. Leave to cool slightly before serving</li>
    </ol>
